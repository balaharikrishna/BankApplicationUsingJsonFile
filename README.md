# How Applicagtion Works:
This Application has A Hierarchy which Includes Positions like,
1.Reserve Bank Manager
2.Bank Head Manager
3.Branch Manager 
4.Staff
5.Customers

1.Once the ReserveBank Manager Account is Available/Created he/she can create a Bank(ex.sbi) with a Name and multiple Head Managers for that respective Bank(sbi).
2.Once the Bank and Bank Head Manager(s) are Created.,Bank Head Manager can create a Branch(nlg) with a Name and multiple Branch Managers for that respective Branch(nlg).
3.Once the Branch and Branch Managers are created.,Branch Manager can/have rights to create a staff Members and customer with their Accounts.
4.Staff can also create customers Accounts.
5.Once the customer is created he/she can do Banking like withdraw,transfer,check account Balance,Print passbook details. and deposit can be done only using Branch Manager/Staff .

*So there is a Dependency in the Application can be seen like below:
ReserveBankManager-->Bank(Bank Manager)-->Branch(Branch Manager)-->Manager-->Staff or Customer.
So without Bank there won't be a Branch.
